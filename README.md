**Fire all of your designers, Tweag, Serokell, Flox (and all other Nix-y companies)!**
</br>This is the ultimate, parametric and reproducible solution to all your branding problems!

It kinda went out of control, and I've made an openscad customizer, which supports a really wide range of Nix logos. Including original one.

Also, for some reason this customizer doesn't support checkboxes and colors, so yeah.

Why, you ask? Cause it's fun!

### Developing

Just [install Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install), run `nix-shell -p openscad --command "openscad ./genix.scad"`, and you are good to go!


*ehm, I just wanted to do a Nix logo, but a pentagram*
