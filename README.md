**Fire all of your designers, Tweag, Serokell, Flox (and all other Nix-y companies)!**
</br>This is the ultimate, parametric and reproducible solution to all your branding problems!

It kinda went out of control, and I've made an openscad customizer, which supports a really wide range of Nix logos. Including original one.


### Running

Just [install Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-installer)

```bash
nix run github:cab404/genix7000
```

### Developing

Run `nix run`, and you are good to go!

Also, you can try using customizer on Thingiverse, but it's baaaad.</br>

*ehm, I just wanted to do a Nix logo, but a pentagram*
